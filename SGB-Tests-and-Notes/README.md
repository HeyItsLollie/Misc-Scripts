# Super Game Boy in GB Studio
## ✨ Lollie's Notes & Tests ✨ ##
This is a repository for the various notes I've made while testing SBG features and GBVM scripting in GB Studio.

I'm a total hobbyist and only poke and prod at GB dev in my own time. Look towards resources like [GB Dev's Pan Docs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/SGB_Functions.html) for more comprehensive documentation!

## Contents <sup><sub>(ordered by SGB command / GBVM feature)</sub></sup> ##
* [**VM\_SGB\_TRANSFER.txt**](VM_SGB_TRANSFER.txt)<br>
 — Big catch-all document with personal notes for `VM_SGB_TRANSFER` commands and related GBVM scripts. Loosely organized and formatted for web viewing, but no guarantees that it'll always be easy to read.

* [**Cheat Sheet - 00h PAL01.png**](Cheat%20Sheet%20-%2000h%20PAL01.png)<br>
 — 15-Bit RGB to Hexadecimal color cheat sheet, for use with `PAL##` commands.

* [**VM\_LOAD\_PALETTE.txt**](VM_LOAD_PALETTE.txt)<br>
 — Alternative for loading palettes at runtime, provided by @toxa in the official GB Studio Discord channel. Frankly, way more user-friendly and flexible. Recommend using this instead of `VM_SGB_TRANSFER` when working with GBVM.
