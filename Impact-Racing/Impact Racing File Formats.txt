This document is intended to aid human reading of
file formats from the PS1 game "Impact Racing",
when viewing files in a Hex editor.

Sample files should be included in the folder:
Misc-Scripts\Impact-Racing\Samples

Note for reading:

2: Data uses two bytes
4: Data uses four bytes

String: Plain text with a variable length
Variable: Binary data with a variable length

=========================================================
                  3DE TEXTURES / MODELS
=========================================================

3DE is an uncompressed pack format, it can store multiple
textures & models. However, game models and textures seem
to be stored in separate files to keep things simpler.

 - Models are plainly named
 
 - Textures share their associated models' filename,
   followed by the suffix "_T"

---------------
  PACK HEADER
---------------

Every .3DE pack starts with this, even if it only contains one entry
4: Will always be "FORM"
4: Length of package in bytes, from this point onwards
4: Will always be "LB3D"

---------------
 ENTRY  HEADER
---------------

This is the start of a file entry
4: Will always be "FORM"
4: Length of current entry in bytes, from this point onwards
4: 4-byte string denoting type of entry
 - TXTR
 - MESH
4: Will always be "NAME"
4: Length of filename
String: The filename
 - Length is specified in previous 4 bytes
 - "00" denotes end of string

---------------
 TEXTURE  DATA
---------------

4: Texture Header, should always be "TXHD"
4: Length of header in bytes. Textures headers are usually 18 bytes / 00 00 00 12
2: Texture Width in pixels
2: Texture Height in pixels
2: Number of colors in palette
4: Unknown, 00 00 01 23
8: Padding? 00 00 00 00 / 00 00 00 00

4: Color Map Header, will always be "CMAP"
 - Indexed color palette
 
4: Length of CMAP in bytes
 - 3 bytes per color, up to 256 colors. (eg: 48 bytes for 16 colors)
 
 - CMAP has a minimum size of 4 bytes (1 color + 00 for padding)
   and a maximum size of 768 bytes (256 colors)
   
 - Palettes are stored as Red/Green/Blue
 
 - Palette entries are stored in reverse order:
   0F 0F 0F / 0E 0E 0E / ... / 01 01 01 / 00 00 00
 
4: Start of entry data, will always be "BODY"
4: Length of entry data in bytes
Variable: The image data itself, length specified previous 4 bytes.
 - Data is stored as one pixel per byte, as an indexed color (CMAP) ranged 00 to FF

---------------
   MESH DATA
---------------

4: Mesh Header, should always be "MSHD"
4: Length of Mesh Header in bytes, seems to always be 16 bytes / 00 00 00 10
4: Number of Vertexes
4: Possibly Faces?
4: Possibly Materials?
4: Unknown

4: Origin Position, "OPOS"
4: Length of OPOS in bytes, should always be 18 bytes / 00 00 00 12
4: Origin coordinates, actual format unknown

4: Vertex Header, should always be "VRTX"
4: Length of Vertex array in bytes
4: Vertex array data
 - 18 bytes per vertex
 - Actual format unknown

4: Normals Header, should always be "NORM"
4: Length of Normals array in bytes
4: Normals array data, format unknown

4: Maps Header, should always be "MAPS"
 - This is referring to texture data
4: Length of Maps Header in bytes
String: Maps name?

There is way more in the mesh data that is yet to be figured out.
FACENREF (or FACE and NREF)
EDGE
TEXMTMHD (or TEXM and TMHD)
MAPC
