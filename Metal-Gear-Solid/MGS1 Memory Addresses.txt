US release of Metal Gear Solid (PS1) 1.0

The majority of this was written up while in
the outdoors area at the start of the game,
immediately after the docks.

Addresses related to Snake/Soldier models
will likely not work outside of this area.

These are not intended to be cheat codes.
Use Bizhawk and edit/freeze RAM directly.

===============================
GAMEPLAY AND SYSTEMS
===============================

027250
C4 9C 00 08: Walk through walls

0ADAB0 - B4
If any of these are set, they'll start to tick down every frame until they reach zero.
During this time, B5 - B8 turn to the value 00, and gameplay freezes.
Gameplay is restored when bytes B0 - B4 reach value 00.

0ADBAC
Follow Cam
00 is overhead, 01 is behind Snake

0B9F72
First Person Cam with view-corrected controls
00 is overhead, 01 is Snake's POV, FF skips transition
0B9F78 is related somehow

1735E2
Snake Model Visible
02 is On
00 is Off

0ADBF8
Radar Object FOV
0D is default

0AE0A0
Pause check
0 - Normal play
2 - Paused
4 - Items (works with camera tweaks, perfect for pausing everything in place)

0AE178
RADAR
0 - Normal
1 - Jammed
2 - Evasion
3 - Alert

0AE17B
Draw or hide entire map (border is still present)

0AE188 - 8D
Snake's hitbox? When all is 00, he can't be seen

0AE208
Does something with cam transitions and speeds
01 snaps cam immediately

0AE1B0
In-game or cutscene? 01 is default, 00 disables UI + ability to switch items

0AE210-11
Camera height relative to ground?

0B7526-7
Current Health

0B7528-9
Max Health

Oxygen
0AE1AC-AD

0B4188 - 8B
Particle layer camera position

0B41B4 - B7
Particle layer camera FOV

0B4187
Particle cam enable/disable - 00 disable, 01 enable

0B416C
Render distance?

0B416E
00 hides UI behind level geometry
10 default
20 and up is UI-only

0B4180
More particle layer positions

0B41BA
Number of entities visible in scene
Crashes if it goes above actual number, or if it goes too low

0B41E1
0B4221
Dither! 02 is enabled, 00 is disabled, on alternating frames. Edit together.

0B4584 - 87
Vertex Lighting setups. It looks like models are shaded based on a direction vector map.
0x0b4587 is an on/off flag.
Some values are missing, and cause crashes.
00/00/0C shows this off perfectly.
00/00/11 is a cool underlit pink
Values may be mirrored every 20 bytes? (00/00/11 and 31 are the same)

0B45C0 and 0B4644
Four bytes, related to vector shading somehow, causes flickering

0BA078
00 - Hide Snake?
01 - Default
02 - Hide Enemies

169780 - CF
One of the enemies' root position, rotation, etc.
In the initial snowy area, this is the guard who walks up and down the right-hand side

1698F0
1698F2
These two freeze the currently-playing animation
Bytes need to be set to 01 and 18 respectively


0B8C4E/96/DE
Enemy current action
00 is default idle
FF is hold

0B8C6E/B6/E6
Enemy health


0B41DC - DF
0B421C - 1F
Render matrix, horizontal and vertical (two bytes each)
Shifting this causes the renderer to shift the render plane.
Basically, you can see exactly where polygons are getting culled.
It helps to edit both simultaneously, both sets are used on alternating frames.


===============================
CAMERA TOOLS
===============================
LOCK CAMERA FIRST
0B9F68-69
02-00 Locks camera, 00-00 restores to normal

POSITION
0B9F58-5D
XX/YY/ZZ

ROTATE AROUND CAMERA TARGET
0B9F60-61
Camera Pitch
0B9F62-63
Camera Orbit

DISTANCE FROM CAMERA TARGET
0B9F6C-6D

CAMERA FOV
0B9F70-71

LOCK TO FIRST PERSON POSITION
(WILL CHANGE POSITION)
0B9F72

Unsure about
50-55
74-77
78

===============================
CAMERA MISC
===============================
(While camera is unlocked)

0B9F20 - 3F
Camera target position

0B9F70 - 73
FOV

0B9F84 - 89
Camera position relative to target?

0B9FA4 - AA
Camera rotation or position from target?

0B9FB9
Something to do with camera position

78-79 Affects transition

Freezing 60 to 6F prevents cam transition movement
Freezing 70 to 7F effectively removes cam transition movement when up against corners
Freezing D0 to EF fucks with the cam transition movement

17659C-9F
Change Memory Pointer For Player Object?
706E1780 was default in S01A
Changing to 70001780 caused player to become simple shadow



===============================
USEFUL FOR GRAPHICS CORRUPTIONS
===============================

0B4350-51
0B4354-55
Something about render timings, edit together.
50/54 are way more granula than 51/55, but can only be set to every 4th number. 00, 04, 08, 0C, etc

0B4165
Seems to shift memory to a specific region, which means editing it
can cause some weird corruptions.
EG:
0B is Vram corruption and freeze
2D affects the polygon draw timings somehow
2E is default!
9B causes the camera to move everywhere.
FC makes UI position freak out 

0B4169
Similar to above
2D causes renderer to slow down to a cool slow ripple

0B41B4
This affects map polygons somehow, causing *some* to zoom towards the camera.
It doesn't make any sense.
Next byte does the same, but crashes the game fast.

0B41D1
More graphical corruption, 32 is the default
Going from 21 to 22 causes some cool texture corruption.

0B41E0 - 0B453F
This whole block affects VRAM in a big way
