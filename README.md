* **Impact Racing** *(PS1)*<br>
 â€” Attempting to document the game's image and model formats, as my first step into learning how to reverse proprietary game file formats. I've currently figured out how to read its image texture format.
* **Metal Gear Solid** *(PS1, 1.0)*<br>
 â€” Keyboard-controlled freecam Lua script, for use in [**Bizhawk**](http://tasvideos.org/Bizhawk.html).
* **R4: Ridge Racer Type-4** *(PS1)*<br>

 â€” Playing with GB Studio and Super Game Boy features, in an attempt to figure out how to use its [**various commands**](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/SGB_Command_Summary.html). I'm attempting to fully document my findings as I figure things out.
