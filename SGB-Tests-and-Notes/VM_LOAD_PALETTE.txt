VM_LOAD_PALETTE         0b11110000, ^/.PALETTE_COMMIT | .PALETTE_BKG/
.CGB_PAL 0,0,0 0,0,0 0,0,0 0,0,0
.CGB_PAL 0,0,0 0,0,0 0,0,0 0,0,0
.CGB_PAL 0,0,0 0,0,0 0,0,0 0,0,0
.CGB_PAL 0,0,0 0,0,0 0,0,0 0,0,0

put R, G, B values instead of zeroes into .GGB_PAL rows
each group of 3 numbers is R, G, B - 4 groups for 4 colors in the palette

0b11110000 is a bit mask. the number of "ones" must match the number of
.CGB_PAL rows. position of 1 in a binary number tells in what palette
next .CGB_PAL row goes.

So if I wanted to only change the third SGB palette, and set it to
a palette with the colors White, Red, Green, and Blue, I would use
the following code as a GBVM script:

VM_LOAD_PALETTE         0b00100000, ^/.PALETTE_COMMIT | .PALETTE_BKG/
.CGB_PAL 31,31,31 31,0,0 0,31,0 0,0,31

Way, way easier.
TODO: Test above to make sure it works as intended.


NalaFala has also made a plug-in to set new palette colors in GB Studio.
I've yet to test this, but it looks like it does the job.
